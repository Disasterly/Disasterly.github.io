               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>The Dixie Wildfire was a large wildfire in California that started on July 13th, 2021 and was fully contained and stopped on October 25th of the same year. The Dixie fire was the 2nd largest wildfire the state has ever seen, where its effects of air pollution could be felt even out of state, in states such as Utah and Colorado.</p>
               <h2>Cause</h2>
               <p>It is believed that faulty equipment from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) caused the fire, as their powerlines sparked a fire. A worker from PG&E noticed a small bush fire starting and tried to extinguish it, however he was unsuccessful. Help was called quickly but it was unsuccessful. It’s important to note that at the time of the fire, there was an illegal drone flying in the area, blocking any attempt from helicopters to help with the fire.</p>

               <h2>Timeline</h2>
               <h3>July</h3>
               <p>On July 13th the wildfire started when a faulty power line sparked, causing the bushes below it to catch on fire. After being unsuccessfully put out by a maintenance worker, the fire brigade was called however they were also unsuccessful, resulting in the wildfire growing even more. The wildfire kept spreading up north, burning over 40000 acres by the 19th, with the fire doubling in size within the next 2 days due to the strong winds and dry weather spreading the flames.</p>
               <p>The fire began to spread towards the east, with it merging with another wildfire unrelated to this case. By the end of the month 240,000 acres were burned, which made the wildfire the 11th largest in California’s history at the current time.</p>

               <h3>August</h3>
               <p>The fire up north split into two, spreading to the west and northeast respectively, ravaging through forests and towns such as Greenville, however the fire was dying out south due to calmer weather.</p>
               <p>On August 16th, winds went up to 48km/h (30mp/h), causing the fire to spread into highways and neighbourhoods, 2 days later, the Dixie wildfire merged with another unrelated fire. The fire threated another town of Milford, but it was protected, and the fire was safely contained, however the fire was still spreading elsewhere.</p>

               <h3>September</h3>
               <p>As summer was ending the weather began to look more favorable for the firefighters, with calm winds, rainfall, and rising humidity, fire spreading was at an all time low. Day by day, more of the fire was contained, and by the 18th of September, 88% of the fire was stopped, with the fire eventually dying down and officially stopping on October 25th.</p>

                  <h2>Damages and Casualties</h2>
                  <p>Although no casualties were reported from the wildfire, 3 firefighters were injured, and 8 citizens went missing. Roughly 1300 buildings were damaged and destroyed, including houses and historic buildings.</p>

                  <h2>Air pollution</h2>
                  <p>As this was one of the biggest wildfires recorded in California’s history, there was a lot of smoke that caused unhealthy air quality not just in California, but in other Western states as well. The air quality was so poor that state temporarily had the worst air in the world.</p>

               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>
                  Hurricane Ophelia or known as Storm Ophelia in Ireland and the UK while being extratropical was regarded as the worst storm to hit Ireland in 50 years, it was also the easternmost Atlantic major hurricane on record.
                  It was the tenth and final consecutive hurricane and the sixth major one of the active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. It originated from a decaying cold front on 6th of October 2017. Situated in a favourable environment the storm strengthened over 2 days and proceeded to drift north and then south-eastwards before becoming a hurricane on the 11th of October 2017. 
                  It started fluctuating in intensity for a day after becoming a category 2 hurricane but then intensified into a major hurricane on the 14th of October 2017 south of the Azores (Portuguese Islands, Autonomous region), it went past the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall. After reaching peak intensity it started weakening as it moved towards Ireland and Great Britain. 
                  It completed the extratropical transition early on the 16th of October 2017. Early on the 17th of October the cyclone crossed the North Sea and started battering Western Norway with wind gusts reaching 70 km/h (43 mph) in Rogaland County before weakening during the evening on the same day, it then crossed across Scandinavia before it dissipated over Norway on the next day.

               <h2>Azores</h2>
               <p>
               The Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere issued a red warning for heavy rainfall on the eastern group of the Azores, São Miguel, Santa Maria and Formigas, on the 14th of October from 17:59 UTC to 23:59 UTC. An orange gale warning was issued for the eastern group for the afternoon through the night of 14-15 October as well as a yellow alert for high seas.
               Rainfall alerts were issued for the central group of islands, Terceira, Graciosa, São Jorge Island, Pico, and Faial.
               The President of the Regional Service of Civil Protection of the Azores, Lieutenant-Colonel Carlos Neves announced there wasn’t any significant damage done. The high winds downed only four trees on São Miguel, three in the Ponta Delgada district and one in Povoação. 
               The island experiences minor flooding. In the central group there was a few instances of light damage done with only one home suffering a roof leak.

               <h2>Iberia</h2>
               <p>
                  Started on the 15th of October 2017 winds from the hurricane fanned wildfires in both Portugal and Spain. The wildfires claimed the lives of at least 49 individuals, including 45 in Portugal and 4 in Spain, dozens more were injured. In Portugal more than 4,000 firefighters battled around 150 fires. 
                  The National Hurricane Centre’s Tropical Cyclone Report on Hurricane Ophelia makes no mention of the fires; thus, the fatalities were not attributed to the cause of the storm.

               <h2>Ireland</h2>
               <p>
               Met Éireann, Ireland`s national meteorological service, reported on 12 October that the storm would reach Ireland. On 15 October, the National Emergency Coordination Centre and Met Éireann convened to advise the public in relation to the post-tropical storm reaching Ireland.
               The Department of Education and Skills confirmed that all Montessoris, crèches, primary and post-primary schools would be closed on 16 and 17 October.
               Bus Éireann announced the cancellation of school bus services for the west of Ireland after Met Éireann issued a rare Status Red warning affecting the southwestern and western counties of Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Clare, Mayo, and Galway. The Department of Housing,
               Planning and Local Government confirmed members of the public should not make any unnecessary journeys especially travelling within the red level warning areas and the department reiterated the storm`s potential risk to life.
               On 16 October, gusts of up to 191 km/h (119 mph) were recorded at Fastnet Rock off the coast of County Cork, the highest wind speeds ever recorded in Ireland. 10-minute sustained wind speeds at Roches Point, also in County Cork, reached 111 km/h (69 mph), with gusts of 156 km/h (97 mph).
               Two people, a man in Dundalk and a woman in Aglish, County Waterford, were killed when trees fell on their cars. Two men died in separate incidents after suffering fatal injuries while carrying out repairs to damage caused by Ophelia and Storm Brian. In Cork, a man died after he fell while working on a shed roof,
               and in County Wicklow another man died after falling from a ladder while carrying out repairs to his farm shed. However, as of 24 October, insurance claims across the country just reached €50 million (US$59 million), much less than the initial estimation of damage.

               <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
               <p>
               The severe weather warning initially issued on 12 October was a yellow weather warning for wind, covering Northern Ireland, northern and western England, Wales, and southern and western Scotland, valid between 12:00 and 23:55 BST on 15 October. Subsequently, on 13 October, a yellow severe weather warning for wind was issued for Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, and northern England, valid between 00:05 and 15:00 BST on 17 October.
               The arrival of Ophelia brought Saharan dust to parts of the United Kingdom, giving the sky an orange appearance, and the sun a red or orange appearance. A strange 'burning' smell was also reported across Devon,
               attributed to the dust, and smoke from forest fires in Portugal and Spain. Winds up to 115 km/h (71 mph) were observed in Orlock Head, County Down, at the height of the storm. Approximately 50,000 households lost power in Northern Ireland. Insurance claims from Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland are estimated to reach £5–10 million (US$6.6–13.3 million).

               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>
                  The eruption began in September 2021 as a flank eruption (The eruption occurs on the flank of the mountain and not the summit) at the Cumbre Vieja volcanic ridge which comprises the southern half of the island La Palma (Spain) in the Canary Islands. It’s the first eruption since Teneguía in 1971.
                  The eruption caused an evacuation of around 7000 people with the lava flow covering over 1000 hectares. The widest part of the flow is 3.5km or 2.3 miles and its around 6.2km long or 3.9 miles with even reaching the sea, the destruction along its path destroyed more than 2600 buildings and cutting
                  the coastal highway and forming a new peninsula, two neighbouring towns of Todoque and Los Campitos were destroyed and reached the town of La Laguna, the eruption has caused one death only. It is reported as the most damaging eruption on La Palma since records were began.

               <h2>Before The Eruption</h2>
               <p>An earthquake swarm (Sequence of seismic events usually occurring around a local area in a short time period) began under Cumbre Vieja on the 11th of September 2021.
                  It slowly reached to the surface with earthquakes around magnitude 3.5, more than 22,000 earthquakes were recorded in the space of a single week. A yellow warning was issued on the potential volcanic activity on the 13th of September,
                  covering 35,000 people in the municipalities of Los Llanos de Aridane, Fuencaliente, El Paso and Villa de Mazo. Around 40 individuals and some livestock on La Palma were evacuated due to the warning.

               <h2>The Eruption</h2>
               <p>The eruption began at 15:13 local time on the 19th of September 2021 in a forested area called Cabeza de Vaca, of Montaña Rajada, in the Las Manchas section of the municipality of El Paso.
                  Around 300 people from the local area were quickly evacuated after the eruption, then a further 700 people (including 500 tourists) were evacuated from the Los Llanos de Aridane coastal region in case the lava flowed to the sea and cut off the main access roads.
                  The total number of evacuees is estimated to be around 5,000 to 10,000. The alert level was raised to the highest (red, due to the eruption) The eruption has taken place from at least 5 main vents.
                  On the fourth day according to the Volcanological Institute of the Canary Islands the volcano entered a more explosive phase and started expelling less volcanic gas.

               <h2>The Eruption Continued</h2>
               <p>For the first 2 months the eruption was assigned a rating of VEI 2 (On a scale of 8) (Volcanic Explosivity Index, used to measure the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions). 
                  On November 20th, 2021, the scientific committee of the Canary Islands Volcanic Emergency Plan (Pevolca) raised the rating from VEI 2 to VEI 3. 
                  Though in modern eruptions where it can be measured, an eruption column (Or eruption plume is a cloud of super-heated ash and tephra suspended in gases emitted during an explosive volcanic eruption) height is often seen to be a more accurate measure, 
                  as in this case it was change on the base of 10 million cubic metres of ejected material measure alone.

               <h2>Reaching The Sea</h2>
               <ul>
                  <li>On October 26th 2021 the lava had flown into the sea due to a magnitude 4.8 earthquake under Mazo</li>
                  <li>On November 10th 2021 a second lava flow reached the sea</li>
                  <li>On November 15th 2021 a third lava flow reached the sea increasing the island area by 40 hectares, the volcanic activity died down but the local air qualtiy was still pretty bad</li>
                </ul>  
               <p></p>
               <p>As of December 6th 2021 there is currently a tsunami warning in place as 14 tremors were registered on Monday morning in La Palma</p>

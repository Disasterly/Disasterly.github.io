               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>The 2011 Tohoku tsunami and earthquake, known as the “Great Tohoku Earthquake” was a 9.0 magnitude earthquake that happened 130km off the east coast, which then resulted in massive tsunami waves, reaching upwards of 40 meters on March 11th.
                  The Great Tohoku Earthquake is the largest earthquake that occurred in Japan and ranked 4th biggest in modern times.
                  However, before the main earthquake there were hundreds of foreshocks, meaning that there were lots of smaller earthquakes, most notably a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on March 9th along with over a thousand aftershocks, with the most recent one occurring in February 2021.

               <h2>Casualties</h2>
               <p>An official report was released by the Japanese Government in 2021, reporting roughly 20000 deaths, 6200 injured and 2500 people still missing to this day. The main causes of death included drowning, burning, and crushing. These numbers may seem low at first and can be misleading, as hundred of thousands of families have lost their homes and were forced to seek shelter. Due to lack of food, mental health, and lack of hospital space, it is believed that the number of deaths is much higher than reported.
                  There were also deaths in other countries. Most notably a man in California was attempting to record the tsunami near a river, getting swept by the water and taken out to sea. His body was found a month later in Ocean Beach in Oregon.

            <h2>Damages</h2>
            <p>The damage caused was devastating, with hundred of thousands of families losing their homes in the Tohoku region. Entire towns were swept, essentially vanishing within minutes. It was reported that over 120,000 buildings fully collapsed, along with over a million buildings receiving heavy damage. This includes hospitals, homes, ports, transport, telephone towers, cultural properties, and even a nuclear plant. Over 4 million people were left without electricity and clean water. 
               As many telephone towers were destroyed, along with the fact that many people tried to call family and friends, communication was often jammed, it was very difficult to get access to anyone in the area.

               <h2>Effects</h2>
               <p>Minutes after the earthquake and tsunami, it began to snow with temperatures going as low as -4C. The earthquake was so powerful that the earths rotation axis moved, which resulted in our days being shorter by 1.8 millionth of a second.
                  The plates have also moved around, causing Japan to widen as much as 2.5 meters.

               <h2>Aftermath</h2>
               <p>Hundreds of thousands of people were left without shelter, food, clean water, and medication. Although every port and train line were closed. Japan decided to open the train lines hours after the incident to move people to shelters.
                  The economic side of Japan also went to shambles, many industrial factories were forced to shut down or were swept by the tsunami, costing over a billion US Dollars. Debris was scattered everywhere throughout the Tohoku region that took 3 years to fully clean up.
